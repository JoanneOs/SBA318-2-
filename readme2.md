Transportation Pay System is a web application designed to manage and calculate driver payments with integrated trip tracking functionality. Built using Node.js, Express, and EJS templates, it offers features such as driver management for both company drivers and truck owners, trip tracking to view and manage transportation trips, automatic payment calculation based on trips and expenses, and a basic user authentication system with profiles. The project is structured with organized directories for data, middleware, public assets, routes, views, and includes an app.js file as the main entry point. To get started, install dependencies using npm install, start the server with npm start, and access the application at http://localhost:3000. The system relies on dependencies like Express, EJS, and Body-parser, providing a streamlined interface for transportation companies to efficiently manage driver payments and trip logistics.
